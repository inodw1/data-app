## REACT-NATIVE APP

Screen 1

Showing 100 posts in a list (Flat List)
A list item displaying the post title and id
List items (posts) are clickable and navigating the user to ‘Screen
2ʼ upon clicking it
The posts are cached so that the second time the app runs it will read
them from the cache
The list is refreshable by pulling down on it and the cache must be
updated

Screen 2

Should show the post that was clicked on Screen 1 in detail (full title and the body is displaying)
